8. Is there any personal suggestions from stakeholders?

## Technical

1. If any, what are the technical restrictions?

Not really. The transferred data should be small as possible due to the internet connection may not be super

2. In which platform (device, technology) should the project be accessed?

Focus platform for the device is android. backward compatible as long as possible from the newest version with the right balance of development effort.

3. How should the platform look like?

Kids are using the courses. It should be easy to use, gamification would be great in sense of points, ranking lists, awards.

4. How can the user access the platform? Is there a sign up process? If yes, which variant (email/password, etc.)?

Every student can sign up. Just register and let’s go. Email / Pw is the standard on wordpress and is the focus. There are some social login plugins for wordpress. Login with google / fb … would be great.

5. Should the user be able to upload an image?

no

6. Should the user complete the personal information or this information are already registered?

Not sure, I would assume that name, surname, email is enough. We have to discuss with CEO.

7. Is there any feedback process from users in the platform?

There will be a feedback process from the volunteers. We could think about an easy Feedback process but that can be build um as a eLearning course to collect the feedback form the user as a quiz. If this works, there is no development effort for you

8. How can the platform be evaluated?

First give some users with or without background of the project the app and try it out.
Give it to the volunteers to get feedback and then to kids in the country.
