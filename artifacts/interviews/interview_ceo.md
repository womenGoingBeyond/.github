The form of the interview was digital. A list of predefined questions was send to the CEO. The sended answers are shown as follows:

## Project
 
1. What is the mission/vision of this project?

The mission of WGB is to teach job and life skills and provide self-development tools, inspire women, and instill innovation in rural areas. We have chosen to focus the operations of our organization on Southeast Asia, as this is one of the poorest regions in the world where gender discrimination and inequality is very much alive, already as of a very young age.
 
2. If any, what are the goals of this project?

The goal is to teach skills that are needed for a job to this target group, translated into the local language, with exams to prove that the students have gained the knowledge. We want to create high-quality courses so that the certificates prove that the students are ready to accomplish their tasks in a job position.
 
3. What is the main target user?

Young women between the ages of 14-20 years old in rural areas of Cambodia. In the first phase, we will focus on the province of Siem Reap. We have chosen this age range and location because women in rural areas especially at this age are the most at risk of not finding a good job and sometimes being abused/entering human trafficking. They tend to have the lowest self-esteem and receive the least resources to become empowered & educated.
 
4. How use/interact the target users this project?

They should be able to access the course content online (on their mobile phones, computers, tablets, from libraries, etc.) and also, download the learning material so they can study offline as well.
 
5. What are the use cases?

Students, instructors, admins
 
6. How should the user be presented in this project (main target platform)?

Students.
 
7. Which range of functionalities is required to be implemented?

The courses will have reading material (text, lessons), videos, audio files (e.g.: for the English pronunciation), pictures, quizzes. The courses are structured in modules â†’ lessons. At the end of each lesson, we will have a quiz (10 questions). At the end of each module, we will have a recapitulative quiz. There will be a final exam, a recapitulative quiz, composed of 50 questions. The students need to have at least 70% correct answers in order to pass the quizzes. Ideally, the students will receive badges: for excellent results, for 100% correct answers, for finishing a module, a course, several courses, etc. and collect points while they make progress in the course.
 
8. Is there any personal suggestions from stakeholders?

The app/platform should be user-friendly, intuitive, and also, make the learning fun for the students.
 
## Technical
 
1. If any, what are the technical restrictions?

The students should be able to move to the next lesson only if they go through the current lesson and pass the quiz at the end of the lesson. The same rule goes for the modules. The students can retake the quizzes as many times as they need until they get the minimum requirement of correct answers in order to pass and move forward with the course (70%).
The students can study at their own pace. There will be no deadlines or restrictions like 1 lesson per day. They can study several lessons per day if they want to.
A student can take several courses but one at a time. The student will be able to study another course only after she finishes the previous one.
 
2. In which platform (device, technology) should the project be accessed?

Mobile phones, computers, laptops, tablets, online/browser from a library or an internet cafe, for instance.
 
3. How should the platform look like?

An app with gamification like for example DuoLingo.
 
4. How can the user access the platform? Is there a sign-up process? If yes, which variant (email/password, etc.)?

The students will create an account on the platform (by providing their personal information) and request to enroll in a course. The admin will grant access to the course after validating the enrollment.
If yes, which variant (email/password, etc.)? - Email address.
 
5. Should the user be able to upload an image?

Like a profile picture or as a part of the study, please?
Profile picture - yes.
In the course - no.
 
6. Should the user complete the personal information or this information are already registered?

The user will fill in the personal information.
 
7. Is there any feedback process from users on the platform?

We will ask the students to give a rating to the course (stars).
 
8. How can the platform be evaluated?

With the feedback from students, ratio of students who finished the course and ratio of students who finished the course and got a job.
