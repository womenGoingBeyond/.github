First, the goals are extract from stakeholder's interview answers and at the end they are refactored based on SMART criteria and prioritized for bachelor thesis's time frame.

## Goals extracted from Interviews

- Users are provided with course materials which can be completed.
- The course materials can be downloaded.
- The course can be completed offline also.
- The user can register and be verified by an admin during the registration process.
- Authentication process with ability to reset the password.
- The user is able to give feedback in form of stars after each course/lesson.
- An app represent a demo for to sync the completed course "to the cloud".


## Refactoring with SMART

- At the end of BA-thesis the user can see all course materials and can complete the provided materials: see videos and texts, hear audios, take quizzes.
- At the end of BA-thesis the course materials can be downloaded by user's mobile device.
- At the end of BA-thesis the user can complete the course offline.
- At the end of BA-thesis the user can register by an email and be verified by an administrator.
- At the end of BA-thesis The registered user can login in system and be able to change/reset the password.
- At the end of BA-thesis the user can send feedback in form of stars after a completed course/module.
- At the end of BA-thesis a Proof of concept in form of a demo app should sync the completed course/lessons to the cloud. 

## Prioritizing

1. At the end of BA-thesis a Proof of concept in form of a demo app should sync the completed course/lessons to the cloud.

5. At the end of BA-thesis the user can register by an email and be verified by an administrator.
6. At the end of BA-thesis the user can send feedback in form of stars after a completed course/module.
7. At the end of BA-thesis The registered user can login in system and be able to change/reset the password.

## The Thesis's Goals

Based on prioritized goals above the first four goals are realistic for the time frame of three month:

1. At the end of BA-thesis a Proof of concept in form of a demo app should sync the completed course/lessons to the cloud.
2. At the end of BA-thesis the user can see all course materials and can complete the provided materials: see videos and texts, hear audios, take quizzes.
3. At the end of BA-thesis the user can complete the course offline.
