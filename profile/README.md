[Women Going Beyond (WGB)](https://www.womengoingbeyond.org/) is an NGO created to empower women in rural areas of SouthEast Asia,
by teaching them essential employment and self-development skills.
We find job opportunities for young women and we prevent them from entering the ring of human trafficking and prostitution.
